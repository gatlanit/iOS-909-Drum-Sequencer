> Samples are from GarageBand's "Modern 909" Drum Kit which have been bounced as ```*.wav``` audio files.

Uses ```SwiftUI``` and ```Timers``` to play samples on a step sequencerÂ

Current issues:
  - Everytime you scroll there is a noticable delay in audio playback
  - Landscape mode is only supported, launching in portrait mode creates issues with GUI
